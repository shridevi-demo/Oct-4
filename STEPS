1. Generate test class by eclipse
2. Add Runwith annotation @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) --> helps understand bean speacific beahviour like autowire, mocking beans etc
3. Add SpringBootTest annotation @SpringBootTest --> helps relate to actual application. Like from where to provide autowired dependency.
4. Analyze the class we are testing and mock all the dependencies.
    For eg, for RESTAPIAdapter, mock RESTCallout object
    For eg, for EventFlowProcessor, mock all dependencies like ValidationServices, TransformService, EnrichmentService, .. .. etc.
5. Autowire the class being tested. So to test RESTAPIAdapter, autowire RESTAPIAdapter.
6. Look for the method signature, which we are going to test. Mock its dependencies.
7. Define behaviour of your mocks, which are called within this method, or by dependencies of this method. [ when. thenReturn or when. thenThrow, etc]
8. Call method in test with mocks / required params 
9. Verify using
